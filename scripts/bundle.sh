# DEVX-560: Add missing vcruntime140_1.dll
# Related to:
# - https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/4293
# - https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/pull/4973
# The upgrade to playwright 1.8.0 does not fix the missing
# DLL issue. As a workaround, we decided to ship it within
# the bundle to avoid modifiying the system image.
