### Workflow

1. Explore open [issues](../../issues). You can take up an existing issue or create a new one to discuss your ideas.
2. Fork the repository on GitHub.
3. Create a topic branch from `main`.
4. Start a pull request and label it as `work in progress`. Describe your contributions.
5. Commit your changes:
   - Use logical commit units.
   - Include clear commit messages.
   - Sign off your commits with `git commit -s -m "describe your change"`.
6. Push your changes to your fork and update your pull request as you make progress.
7. Engage with any feedback from maintainers.
8. When complete, remove the `work in progress` label and notify maintainers for review.
9. Your pull request needs approval from two [maintainers](MAINTAINERS).

### Commit Messages

Your commit messages should answer two questions: what changed and why? The subject should state what was changed, and the body should explain why.

Reference the corresponding issue ID in your pull request description.

```bash
git commit -s -m "your detailed description of the change"
```
